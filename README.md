## Building

Assuming the developer already installed the necessary tools to work with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), these are the steps one should follow to run the frontend on their local machine:
 - Build and run Scaddr's backend. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/scaddr/scaddr-backend)
 - Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/scaddr/scaddr-frontend`
 - Go into the frontend directory `cd scaddr-frontend`
 - Install all the node dependencies `npm install`
 - Run the frontend `npm run serve`
 - Enjoy
